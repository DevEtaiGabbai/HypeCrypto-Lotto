and deploy the smart contract with

`truffle migrate`  

Finally, to open the web app,  

`npm run dev`

And to build run

## Miscellaneous
 • The majority of the code powering the app is located in `contracts/Lottery.sol` and `src/js/app.js` - if you'd like to see how the app works in any way, that's probably the place to go.

 • The source of randomness for this lottery system comes from a SHA-256 hash taken from the blockchain timestamp and number.

 • Feel free to submit a pull request if you have any changes or suggestions to make. :)
